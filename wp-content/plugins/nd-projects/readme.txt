### WHY SHOULD I USE THE PLUGIN ?
The Cost Calculator plugin allows you to create unlimited forms using various layout options and different field types (select, slider, switcher etc.). For each field used you can set a specific price that will change depending on the user's interaction and choices. The Cost Calculator plugin is very useful to show to your user an estimate cost of your product or service and it will encourage the user to contact your company for more information.

The plugin does not only have a Cost Calculator inside it but it also has a "Projects" module through which you can insert infinite Projects and show to your clients your Portfolio works, the single project page containing custom fields (budget, author, duration, year of creation, etc ..) and an automatic layout template optimized to show your project in the best possible way.

### HOW DOES THE PLUGIN WORKS ?
The plugin is developed with [Ajax](https://codex.wordpress.org/AJAX) technology in order to improve the user experience and increase interaction performance with your customer, in this way the price calculation will be in real time and the page load will not be required to see the final price . To create the effects of Slider, select and switcher we used the native WordPress [JQuery UI](https://jqueryui.com/) library, this for don't introduce new libraries and keep the code always lighter and faster in order to increase the performance as much as possible and avoid any incompatibility with plugins and external themes.
